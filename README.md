<h1 align="center"> 90 Days of DSA </h1>

In this repo I'm going to solve a leetcode problem everyday

This is a repo to practice DSA for myself.

you can get the solution for the leetcode problems here

## DAY 0:

On Day 0 I started solving the simple Twosum problem in `js` and `c++`.

you can find the solutions in `TWOSUM` folder above

## DAY 1:

on Day 1 I solved a simple leetcode code problem called valied paranthesis in `c++` and `Js`.

you can find the solution in `validParathesis` folder above

## DAY 2:

on Day 2 I learned about the different sorting algorithms and implemented Bubble,Insertion and Selection sorting algorithms in C++ and Javascript.

check out `Sortings` directory to find the sorting algorithms in C++ and Javascript

## DAY 3:

On Day 3 I solved a easy level leetcode problem called LongestCommonPrefix in C++ and Javascript

you can find the solution in `LongestCommmonPrefix`.

## DAY 4:

on Day 4 I solved a easy level leetcode problem called `CheckifPangram`. Pangram is a string which consists all the letter in the alphabets atleast once.

check out the `Pangram` directory for the solution

## DAY 5:

on Day 5 I learned about the singlyLinkedList and Implemented it in C++ from scratch.

Checkout the `Datastructures/LinkedList` directory for the code.

## DAY 6:

on Day 6 I learned about doubly linked list and implemnted some of the features and also implemented tail node for efficient insetiion and deletion.

checkout the `Datastructures/DoublyLinkedlist` directoy for the implementation.

## DAY 7:

on Day 7 I solved a easy leeetcode problem called `SearchIndexPostition` in Both `C++ using Binary search` (effiecinet manner) and `Js using while loop`.

you can find the solution in `SearchInserPos` directory.

## DAY 8:

on Day 8 I Learnt about `MergeSort` and Implemented in `c++` and `Js`. It is one of the most efficient sorting algorithm with `O(nlogn)` time complexity.

you can find the Implementation in `sortings/MergeSort` directory.

## DAY 9:

on Day 9 I solved `removeElement`,`removeDuplicateFromSortedArray`,`removeElementsFromSortedArrayII` problems on leetcode in both `C++` and `Js` in most efficient ways.

you can find the Implementation in their respective directories.

## DAY 10:

on Day 10 I solved `Rotate Array`,`majorityElement` problems on leetcode in both `C++` and `Js` in bruteforce and efficient ways

you can find the solution for the given problems in their respective directories.

## DAY 11:

on Day 11 I solved `Best Time To Buy Sell Stock`,`Best Time To Buy Sell Stock II` problems on leetcode in Both `C++` and `JS` in brute force and efficient ways.

you can find the solution for the given problems in their respective directories.

## DAY 12:

on Day 12 I solved `Length of Last String problem` problem on leetcode in `C++` and `JavaScript` in efficient way

you can find the solution for the given problems in their respective directories.

## DAY 13:

on Day 13 I solved `Find the first occurence in a string` on leetcode in `C++` and `JavaScript`.

you can find the solution for the given problems in their respective directories.

## DAY 14:

on Day 14 I solved `Search in 2D array`,`JumpGame` on leetcode in `C++` and `Javascript`.

you can find the solution for the given problems in their respective directories.

## DAY 15:

on Day 15 I solved `Search In Rotated Array` on leetcode in both `C++` and `JS.`

you can find the solution in respective directories.

## DAY 16:

on Day 16 I solved `JumpGame II` on leetcode in both `C++`,`Javascript`.

you can find the solution in respective directories.
